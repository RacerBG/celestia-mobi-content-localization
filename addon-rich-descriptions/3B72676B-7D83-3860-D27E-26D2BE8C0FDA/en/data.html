<p>Mir is a Soviet/Russian space station that operated in LEO from 1986 to 2001. Comprising of seven different modules, it is the first modular space station ever assembled in space, and throughout its history, it hosted 30 long-duration expeditions, each carrying three astronauts arriving via a Soyuz or a Space Shuttle, with stays ranging from 7 to 434 days. The experience acquired in space station assembly paved the way for other modular space stations like the ISS and Tiangong to also be built</p>
