<p>The Voskhod project is an interim Soviet manned space program that ran from 1964 to 1966, concurrent with NASA's Project Gemini program. Derived from the earlier Vostok capsule, the Voskhod was the first spacecraft to carry two and three people to space at a time, and in March 18, 1965 saw the first successful EVA or spacewalk by Alexey Leonov. However, the program was abruptly terminated following the introduction of the much advanced Soyuz spacecraft, which continues to fly to this day</p>
