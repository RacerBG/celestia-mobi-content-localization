<p>2023 DZ₂ is a 70-m wide near-Earth asteroid of the Apollo group. Upon its discovery, this asteroid had a 1-in-430 chance that it will collide with Earth on 2026-Mar-26, almost concurrently with another asteroid, 2023 DW. However, as of 2023-Mar-21, further observations ruled out this possibility as it will only pass at a safe distance of 4.5 million km on that date.</p>
