It was a global mapping mission that examined the entire planet, and also served as communications relay for surface probes such as <a href="celaddon://item?item=6237BAE7-2CE9-F379-14F1-C88B814BD767">Pathfinder</a> and the twin <a href="celaddon://item?item=54D2D839-2379-7CC1-FFEF-D2BDBDC8C8A8">Mars Exploration Rovers</a>.
