<p>The planet Ba'ku is an M-class planet located in the Briar Patch. It has been the location of a Ba'ku colony since the mid-21st century, and is characterized by a unique effect caused by the planet's rings that cause the planet's inhabitants not to age.<br>Ba'ku is a ringed planet, the rings themselves being saturated with metaphasic radiation. The planet is home to a Ba'ku settlement, established in 2066 by a group of approximately 600 of the Ba'ku, fleeing their homeworld for fear of their race's self-destruction. The planet's radiation allowed the inhabitants to live extended life spans, In the late 23rd century, a group of the Ba'ku, disillusioned with the settlement's ways, left the planet, and became the Son'a.<br>In 2375, an attempt by the Son'a led by Ahdar Ru'afo, and assisted by Starfleet officers under Matthew Dougherty to strip the planet of its metaphasic particles and to forcefully relocate the Ba'ku to another planet, was stopped by the actions of Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the USS Enterprise-E.</p>
