<p>Quoted from fyr02's original Forums post: "Very recently I derived this set of exoplanetary albedo maps from the phase curve data presented in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.00498.pdf">Shporer and Hu (2015)</a>. There is no color, only black and white, because phase curves were presented only in the Kepler band (wavelength 598nm). Black areas are unmapped under the assumption that the planets are tidally locked, which is likely to be the case."</p>
