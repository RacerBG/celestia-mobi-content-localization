<p>16 Psyche is a large M-type asteroid in the asteroid belt, discovered by Annibale de Gasparis on March 1852. Psyche has a diameter of 253 km. Psyche is believed to contain much more iron, nickel, platinum and gold than Earth, and that its total value would be 10 thousand quadrillion dollars. In 2023 or 2024, NASA will launch the Psyche spacecraft towards the asteroid, and it will enter its orbit in 2029 or 2030, to study it for 21 months.</p>
