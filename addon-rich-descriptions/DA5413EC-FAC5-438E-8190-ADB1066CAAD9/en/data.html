<p>Kepler-1513, also known as KOI-3678 and Gaia-TROI-127, is a K-type main sequence star about 1,147 light-years away in the constellation Lyra. In 2022, studies of the transit-timing variations of its one known planet suggested the existence of a Moon-to-Mars-mass satellite, making it the only the third strong candidate exomoon and the smallest one detected so far (the first two exomoons at <a href="celaddon://item?item=999C0059-DBC6-F763-E5E4-8E5F41F80450">Kepler-1625</a> and <a href="celaddon://item?item=5018AB8D-5C3F-C380-895A-EBAEABC6EE9A">Kepler-1708</a> were Neptune-sized).</p>
