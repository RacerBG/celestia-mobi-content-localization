<p>This adds Ramiel - The 6th Angel (or 5th originally) in a low Earth Orbit slightly larger and longer then that of the Hubble Space Telescope. The model for this addon was originally from the Modeler's Resource (ripped by Models124717) and converted to CMOD by Anthony_B_Russo10. Later updates added other objects from the Evangelion series.</p>
