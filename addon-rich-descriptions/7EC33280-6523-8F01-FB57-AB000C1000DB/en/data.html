<p>The Voyager program consists of two NASA space probes to study the outer planets of the Solar System. Both launched in 1977, studied Jupiter and Saturn, and Voyager 2 had its mission extended and studied Uranus and Neptune. In 1990, when the two probes concluded their main mission, they had their missions extended to the study of interstellar space. In 2022, both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 remain active, and are expected to run at least until 2025-2030 when the power in their RTGs runs out.</p>
