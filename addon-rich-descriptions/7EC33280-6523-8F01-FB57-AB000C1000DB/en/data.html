<p><strong>Voyager 1 and 2</strong> were twin NASA spacecraft that explored all the outer planets in the Solar System from 1979 to 1989, following the success of <a href="celaddon://item?item=C276F25A-DFE6-7F33-10D1-135C7DA4AB72">Pioneer 10 and 11</a>. After completing the only flybys of Uranus and Neptune to this day, both Voyagers became the first active spacecraft to reach interstellar space, and are expected to continue studying it until their RTGs run out of power by 2025-2030</p>
