<p>The <strong>James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)</strong> is a joint NASA/ESA/CSA observatory that is planned to succeed the <a href="celaddon://item?item=9368F0C1-BF71-FA3D-A521-A13AAA5B84E7">Hubble Space Telescope</a> as NASA's flagship astrophysics mission. After many years of delays, it finally lifted off the ground on 2021-Dec-25 atop an Ariane 5 (ECA) rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. It arrived on the Sun-Earth Lagrange point-2 on January 2022, and has been continuously observing the cosmos since June 2022</p>
