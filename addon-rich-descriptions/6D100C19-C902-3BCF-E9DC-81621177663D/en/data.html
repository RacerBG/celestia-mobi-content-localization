<p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a joint NASA/ESA/CSA observatory that is planned to succeed the Hubble Space Telescope as NASA's flagship astrophysics mission. After many years of delays, it finally lifted off the ground on 2021-Dec-25 atop an Ariane 5 (ECA) rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. On 2022-Jan-24, it has arrived on the Sun-Earth Lagrange-2 point, and is now on a commissioning phase which will last until June 2022</p>
