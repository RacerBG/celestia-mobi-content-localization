<p>This addon adds 4 space debris objects. The Centaurs that propelled Juno and Lucy to heliocentric orbit, the Kepler Booster and the object 6Q0B44E.</p>
<p>
  NOTES:
  <ul>
    <li>The model used for the Kepler Booster is that of the Centaur, but it does not correspond to the actual stage that propelled it into a heliocentric orbit. No one has (yet) modeled the true stage that was used in the Kepler mission.</li>
    <li>The model "X" used for the 6Q0B44E object is generic, as no one knows for sure what this object is really about.</li>
  </ul>
