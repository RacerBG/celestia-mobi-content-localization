<p>This adds a representation of the Hyperion Proto-supecluster. It is represented as a galaxy due to Celestia limits and it is impossible to get a good view due to galaxy render limits. Due to the distance the proto super cluster is at, it may not appear as visible due to Celestia's render limits on how far out it will show galaxies.</p>
