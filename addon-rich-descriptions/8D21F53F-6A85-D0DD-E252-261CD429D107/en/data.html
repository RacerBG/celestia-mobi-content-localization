<p>Compton is a gamma-ray observatory operating from 1991-2000. The second of NASA's five Great Observatories, it is launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis during STS-37, and contributed to understanding one of the universe's most energetic phenomena, the GRBs. It was deorbited on 2000-Jun-4, after nine years of service, and was succeeded by the European INTEGRAL spacecraft</p>
