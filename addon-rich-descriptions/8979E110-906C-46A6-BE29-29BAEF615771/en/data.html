<p>C/2022 E3 (ZTF) is the 5th comet discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility overall. Reaching perihelion on January 2023 after a 44,000-year journey inbound, it was believed to originate from the Oort Cloud. On 2023-Feb-1, this comet makes its closest approach to Earth at the distance of 42 million km, and is expected to reach AppMag +6.0 at its brightest. Its outbound hyperbolic trajectory shows that this comet would be ejected from the Solar System altogether</p>
