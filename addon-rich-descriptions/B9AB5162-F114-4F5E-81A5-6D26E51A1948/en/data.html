<p>KMT-2020-BLG-0414L is a red dwarf star accompanied by a brown dwarf about 3,653 light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius. A cold rocky planet slightly larger than Earth was found orbiting within 1.6 AU from its host star. If it has an atmosphere, this planet is cold enough for oceans of liquid methane to form, much like on Saturn's largest moon, Titan</p>
