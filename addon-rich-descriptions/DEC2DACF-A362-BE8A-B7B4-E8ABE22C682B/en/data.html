<p>Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 is a comet that broke into at least 21 fragments due to its close encounter with Jupiter in 1992. It has garnered the interest of many astronomers as it was predicted to collide with Jupiter on July 1994. It was speculated that it was a short-period comet that was captured by Jupiter's gravity sometime in the 1970s, and measured about 5 km in diameter before its 1992 break-up. The collision events contributed greatly to the knowledge that Jupiter's strong gravitational influence decreases the chances of asteroid/comet impacts to occur particularly on Earth</p>
