<p>The Solar Maximum Mission (SolarMax) is a solar observatory launched in February 1980 that prematurely malfunctioned in November of the same year. Four years later, it became the first-ever satellite repaired in space during the STS-41-C (Challenger) mission in April 1984. Afterwards it continued to observe the Sun until an intense geomagnetic storm on March 1989 accelerated its orbital decay until it reentered the Earth's atmosphere on December 1989</p>
