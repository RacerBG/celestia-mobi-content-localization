<p>NASA's twin probes, <strong>Pioneer 10</strong> and <strong>11</strong>, were the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter and Saturn, and the first of (so far only) five spacecraft that achieve escape velocity from the Sun. Although the data sent back were of relatively poor quality compared to modern standards, and did not reach interstellar space while operational, it laid the groundwork for the success of all future missions to the outer solar system, starting with the <a href="celaddon://item?item=7EC33280-6523-8F01-FB57-AB000C1000DB">Voyager program</a>.</p>
