<p><p>Salyut 7 was a Soviet space station in orbit from 1982 to 1991. Until 1986, it was visited by a total of six long-duration expedition crews and four short-term ones arriving on Soyuz T spacecraft, with the longest lasting 237 days. It is the ninth and last of the Salyuts ever launched, and while not as successful as its <a href="celaddon://item?item=FF47F01E-3583-92F1-3C14-C152D503DC9C">immediate predecessor</a>, it paved the way for building and maintaining large, modular space stations over long periods of time, starting with <a href="celaddon://item?item=3B72676B-7D83-3860-D27E-26D2BE8C0FDA">Mir</a></p>
