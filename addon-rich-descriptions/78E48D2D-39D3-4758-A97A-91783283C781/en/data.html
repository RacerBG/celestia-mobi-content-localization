<p>The Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) was a short-lived NASA lunar exploration and technology demonstration mission. It was the only spacecraft launched from a Minotaur V rocket on 2013-Sept-7. During its seven-month mission, LADEE orbited around the Moon's equator, using its instruments to study the thin lunar exosphere and dust. The mission ended on 2014-Apr-18, when the spacecraft intentionally crashed LADEE into the far side of the Moon, later determined to be near the eastern rim of Sundman V crater.</p>
