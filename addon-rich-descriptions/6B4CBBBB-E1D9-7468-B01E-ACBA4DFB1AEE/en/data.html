<p>Phoenix is a NASA spacecraft that landed on the northern regions of Mars in 2008. Its mission is to assess local habitability and to research the history of water on Mars. It reused the hardware meant for the cancelled Mars Surveyor 2001 mission, and fulfilled the objectives set for the failed Mars Polar Lander in 1999. Phoenix's design also became the basis for the InSight mission just ten years after the former's mission is completed</p>
