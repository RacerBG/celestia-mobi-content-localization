<p><p>99942 Apophis is a 370-m potentially hazardous asteroid that caused a short period of concern in December 2004 when initial observations briefly indicated a probability up to 2.7% that it would hit Earth on 2029-Apr-13. Later observations ruled out this possibility and instead will fly past Earth about 36,530 km on that date.</p>
