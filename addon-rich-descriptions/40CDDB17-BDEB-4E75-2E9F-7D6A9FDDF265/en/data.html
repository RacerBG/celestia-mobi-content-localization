<p><strong>Pioneer 6</strong>, <strong>7</strong>, <strong>8</strong>, and <strong>9</strong> were a series of interplanetary space probes launched between 1965 and 1969, which monitored various solar phenomena from widely separated points in space, much like the twin <a href="celaddon://item?item=8E69D417-B7D7-C09C-433B-1D7C9790B100">STEREO</a> probes do today. Designed to last only six months, all the probes managed to operate for decades, with Pioneer 6 lasting until 2000-Dec-8, more than 35 years after its launch!</p>
