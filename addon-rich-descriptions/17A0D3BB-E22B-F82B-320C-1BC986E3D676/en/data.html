<p>This addon depicts the primary setting of James Cameron's 2009 film, Avatar. In that film, the planet and its moons were discovered orbiting Alpha Centauri A in 2050, and the planet was close enough that by 2137, humanity is able to explore it with their recently developed FTL technology within six years. The primary story of the first film and its sequel takes place on a habitable moon known as Pandora, which is home to a sentient humanoid culture known as the Na'vi.</p>
