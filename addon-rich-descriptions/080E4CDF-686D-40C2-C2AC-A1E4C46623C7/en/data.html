<p>OGLE-2013-BLG-0341L is a binary star system consisting of two red dwarfs, with a cold, terrestrial-mass planet in orbit around the secondary star, rendered here as a Titan-like world. It was the first cold terrestrial exoplanet discovered by microlensing, and the first overall outside of the PSR B1257+12 system.</p>
