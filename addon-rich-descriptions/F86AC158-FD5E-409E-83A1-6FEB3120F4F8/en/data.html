<p>An addon that brings a spectacular view of the history of our planet Earth, from 4.5 billion to 20 million years in the past. This addon adds 46 alternate surfaces for Earth, showing what our planet might have looked like at different times.</p>
<p>
    NOTES:
    <ul>
      <li>If you install this addon, it is highly recommended that you also install the <a href="celaddon://item?item=5338AEF4-EA7E-49C8-A4D0-FF1297F8182F">Earth</a> addon, so that the default Earth texture matches these alternate surfaces.</li>
      <li>When viewing the alternate surface "4500 million years ago", you must disable the atmosphere and clouds in Celestia's settings.</li>
    </ul>
