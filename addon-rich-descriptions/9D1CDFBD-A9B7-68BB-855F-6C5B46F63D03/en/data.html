<p>Salyut 1 is the first space station in the history of space exploration. After the USSR lost the Moon Race, they gradually shifted their focus into long-term human habitation of LEO. The station was launched in 1971-Apr-19 and was to receive the crew of Soyuz 10 just three days later, but a docking failure aborted this mission. The first humans to board a space station was the crew of Soyuz 11, who stayed aboard for 23 days. However, the Soyuz 11 crew were killed by asphyxiation during their return trip to Earth. The redesign phase of Soyuz took longer than expected, and Salyut 1 was later deorbited on 1971-Oct-11</p>
<p><i>(NOTE: This addon includes some week-long Soyuz test flights that didn't visit any space station from 1972-1976)</i></p>
