<p>Helios 1 and 2 were the twin spacecraft sent by NASA and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to study the Sun in multiple close flybys between 1974 and 1976. Helios 1 was operational from 1974-1986, while Helios 2 did so from 1976-1980. They were the closest artificial objects to approach our star until the Parker Solar Probe became operational in 2018.</p>
