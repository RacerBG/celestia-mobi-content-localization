<p>Diwata-1 is the first Filipino microsatellite ever put into space. It is a small 50-kg cubesat dedicated to Earth observations and technology demonstration. It was launched and deployed from the International Space Station on 2016-Apr-27, and it imaged the Earth continuously until it reenters the atmosphere on 2020-Mar-20.<br>Lessons learned from operating this satellite led to the creation of the country's STAMINA4Space program currently operated by the newly established Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA) in 2019.</p>
