<p>The Leased Satellite (Leasat) program, also known as Syncom-IV, were the first satellites designed to be specifically launched by a Space Shuttle. Weighing 3.4 tons and measuring 6.17 m when fully deployed, these satellites provided communications for the US military and its allies during the later years of the Cold War. Designated internally as HS-381 satellites, a total of four were built (with an additional spare) by Hughes Communications, each one launching from 1984 to 1990. All satellites were decommissioned into their respective graveyard orbits since 2015</p>
