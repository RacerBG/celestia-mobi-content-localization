<p>Astrobotic's <strong>Peregrine Mission One</strong> is a lunar lander selected as the first of many missions under NASA's <i>Commercial Lunar Payload Services</i> (CLPS) program. Launched during Vulcan Centaur's maiden flight on 2024-Jan-8, it is supposed to make the first US lunar landing since <a href="celaddon://item?item=B6929DF5-62CA-497B-B38D-651CC175177E">Apollo 17</a> in 1972, however a fault occurred shortly after separation from the rocket, and the landing attempt had to be abandoned. It reentered the Earth's atmosphere just 10 days later, on 2024-Jan-18</p>
