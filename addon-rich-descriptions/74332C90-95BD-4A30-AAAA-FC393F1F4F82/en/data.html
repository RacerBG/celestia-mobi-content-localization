<p>The European Retrievable Carrier (EURECA) is an unmanned 4.5 ton satellite equipped with 15 scientific instruments. It was deployed from Space Shuttle Atlantis during mission STS-46 in 1992-Aug-2. EURECA then stayed in orbit for almost a year performing experiments before it was retrieved in 1993-Jul-1 by Space Shuttle Endeavour during STS-57. Originally slated to fly again to space five more times, but they are cancelled for budgetary reasons. Today, the satellite is on permanent display at the Swiss Museum of Transport in Luzern, Switzerland since 2000.</p>
