<p>The first generation satellites of the still-active Explorers program were among the very first spacecraft successfully launched into orbit by the United States. Although unable to beat <a href="celaddon://item?item=A2BBB352-E310-C92D-F99D-18F4727D7646">Sputnik</a> on being the first artificial object in orbit, the Explorers (particularly <strong>Explorer 1</strong>) discovered the existence of a region of charged particles around the Earth's magnetosphere called the Van Allen radiation belts. Five satellites were launched in 1958, only three were successful (<strong>1</strong>, <strong>3</strong> and <strong>4</strong>). All of them operated for four months each, but stayed derelict in orbit for many years until 1970</p>
