<p>This add-on includes several hypothetical bodies theorized but not found or later discovered not to exist. These all were seriously believed to exist at some time in the past, whether due to observational mistakes or errors in Newtonian physics. The objects added are the hypothesized planets Vulcan and Planet X along with the once hypothesized moons Lilith, Neith, and Themis. Recently updated to fix the lack of texture issue with Planet X.</p>
