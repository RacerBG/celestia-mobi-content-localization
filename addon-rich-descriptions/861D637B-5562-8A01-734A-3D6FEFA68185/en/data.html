<p>New Horizons is a NASA/APL space probe that was launched as a part of NASA's New Frontiers program. It was launched in 2006 with the primary mission to perform a flyby study of the Pluto system in 2015, and a secondary mission to fly by and study one or more other Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) in the decade to follow, which became a mission to 486958 Arrokoth in 2019. It is the fifth space probe to achieve the escape velocity needed to leave the Solar System.</p>
