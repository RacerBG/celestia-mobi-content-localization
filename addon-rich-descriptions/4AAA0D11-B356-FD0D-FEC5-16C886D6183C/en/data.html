<p>This addon adds Darwin IV, the fictional planet from Wayne Barlowe's book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_(book)"><i>Expedition</i></a> and the TV docufiction <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Planet"><i>Alien Planet</i></a>. I've tried to keep it as accurate to the book as possible, but some data had to be extrapolated or guessed, and I've placed the system at 10 times its stated distance of 6.5 light-years so it doesn't mess up Earth's night sky.</p>
<p>Note that this addon may cause naming conflicts if you have another addon with an object named Darwin, such as the Orion's Arm planet.</p>
