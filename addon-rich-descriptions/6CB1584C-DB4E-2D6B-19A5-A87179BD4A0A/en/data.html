<p>Tianwen-1 is a space probe of the China National Space Administration (CNSA) destined for the planet Mars. It launched on July 23, 2020 and entered Mars orbit on February 10, 2021. Tianwen-1 also carried the Zhurong rover, which landed on the Martian surface on May 14, 2021. The Tianwen-1 orbiter and the rover Zhurong remain operating in 2022.</p>
<p>NOTE: This addon will only show Tianwen-1 on its Earth to Mars cruise trajectory. The probe's trajectory around Mars has not yet been added. Also note that this addon does not add the Zhurong rover.</p>
