<p>Nozomi (also known as PLANET-B) was a Japanese spacecraft that failed to orbit around Mars due to a series of electrical malfunctions. Launched in 1998, it was supposed to arrive on Mars by Oct 1999, but an engine failure on its final swing-by delayed it until Dec 14, 2003. However, it only performed a flyby as the spacecraft has insufficient fuel to insert itself into a proper Martian orbit, thereby terminating the mission. A similar fate almost killed the Akatsuki mission just seven years later</p>
