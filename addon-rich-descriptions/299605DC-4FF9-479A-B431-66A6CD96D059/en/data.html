<p>Pl√©iades is the CNES (French national space agency) program designed as the follow-on to its highly successful Spot series of low Earth orbit (LEO) multi-mission observation satellites, which has operated an uninterrupted service since 1986. Two satellites were launched from Kourou aboard Soyuz-2 rockets in 2011 and 2012, both of which are still active as of 2023</p>
