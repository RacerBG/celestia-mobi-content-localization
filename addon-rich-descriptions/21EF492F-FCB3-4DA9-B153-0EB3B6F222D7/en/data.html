<p>TrES-3, also known as Pipoltr and TOI-2126, is a Sun-like star about 759 light-years away in the constellation Hercules. It hosts a transiting planet given the proper name Umb채채ssa, which is slightly larger than Jupiter and completes an orbit once every 1.3 days. This addon includes a fictional texture for the planet that's in approximate true color based on spectra.</p>
