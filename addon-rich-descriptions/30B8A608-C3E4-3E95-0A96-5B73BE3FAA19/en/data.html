<p>Comet <strong>Wild 2</strong> is a former Halley-type comet when an encounter with Jupiter in 1974 reduced its orbital period from 43 years to just 6 years. This significant orbital change led to its selection as the primary target for NASA's <a href="celaddon://item?item=35F57A39-2071-2665-771D-DE9EDF6685B2">Stardust</a> mission, where it collected samples of its coma in 2004 for further study back on Earth</p>
