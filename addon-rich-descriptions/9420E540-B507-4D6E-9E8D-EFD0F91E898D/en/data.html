<p>The Fra Mauro Highlands is a widespread hilly geological area thought to have formed from ejecta created by the impact that formed Mare Imbrium about 4.25 billion years ago. Originally planned to be visited by Apollo 13 in April 1970, it was extensively explored by Apollo 14 in February 5, 1971</p>
