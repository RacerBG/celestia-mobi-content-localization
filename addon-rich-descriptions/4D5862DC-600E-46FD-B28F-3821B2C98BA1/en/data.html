<p>HIP 65426 is a young A-type main sequence star about 350 light-years away in the constellation Centaurus. In 2017, a distant super-Jovian planet was discovered via direct imaging, and in 2022 it became the first exoplanet to be directly imaged by the <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/09/01/nasas-webb-takes-its-first-ever-direct-image-of-distant-world/">James Webb Space Telescope</a>. The star and planet are among 20 star systems that will receive formal names as part of the <a href="https://www.nameexoworlds.iau.org/2022edition">NameExoWorlds (2022)</a> campaign.</p>
