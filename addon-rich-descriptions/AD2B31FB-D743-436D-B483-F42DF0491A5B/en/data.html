<p>Kepler-61, also known as KOI-1361, is a K-type main sequence star about 1,103 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus. In 2013, a planet 2.15 times larger than Earth was discovered orbiting the star's habitable zone. However, subsequent analyses indicate that this planet has a very eccentric orbit that takes it outside the stellar HZ. These characteristics, in addition to now theoretically believed to be closer in composition to a warm neptunian rather a superterran, has led to its removal from the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog in 2021</p>

  NOTES:
  <ul>
    <li>The planet's texture depicts it as Earth-like, following its discovery report in 2013</li>
    <li>Two alternate versions of the planet's map are included, the default one by John van Vliet, and the other by 星颜Crazy</li>
