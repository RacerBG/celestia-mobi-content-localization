<p>NGC 3132 (also known as the Southern Ring Nebula, Eight-Burst Nebula, or Caldwell 74) is a bright and extensively studied planetary nebula, with a binary central star, in the constellation Vela. Its distance from Earth is estimated at about 2,500 light-years. This nebula was one of the first targets for imaging by the James Webb Space Telescope in 2022, although since the original version of this addon was made well before that, the model is based on Hubble imagery.</p>
