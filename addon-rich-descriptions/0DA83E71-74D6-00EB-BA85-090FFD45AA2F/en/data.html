<p>Salyut 3, also known secretly as Almaz 2, was a Soviet space station in orbit for only 7 months between 1974 and 1975. Together with its ill-fated sibling, Salyut 2 (which was destroyed by orbital debris), they were designed as manned spy satellites for the Soviet military. Salyut 3 is notable for being the only known spacecraft to carry an onboard gun. It was only visited once by a cosmonaut crew. Both Salyut 2 and Salyut 3 are the third and fourth space stations launched as part of the Salyut series</p></p>
<p>NOTES:<ul><li>Salyut 2, the failed predecessor of Salyut 3, is also included in this add-on</li><li>The exact location of Salyut 3's onboard gun (a modified Rikhter R-23 anti-aircraft cannon) is never revealed. As a result, this isn't modelled on this addon</li><li>Requires the Soyuz: 1971-1981 addon for the visiting missions (to become available in the near-future)</li></ul></p>
