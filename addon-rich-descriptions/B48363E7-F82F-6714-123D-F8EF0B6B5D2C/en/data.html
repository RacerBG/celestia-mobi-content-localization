<p>Fomalhaut is a triple star system consisting of an A-type and K-type main-sequence stars and a red dwarf about 25 light-years away in the constellation Pisces Austrinus. From 2008 to 2020, a planet was suspected to be forming in the protoplanetary disk surrounding the primary star of the system, until it was later determined it is just a dense cloud of debris within the disk</p>
