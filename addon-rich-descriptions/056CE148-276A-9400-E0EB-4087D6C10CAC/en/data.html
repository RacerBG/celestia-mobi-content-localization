<p>51 Pegasi, formally named Helvetios, is a Sun-like star located 50.45 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Pegasus. It was the first main-sequence star found to have an exoplanet (later named Dimidium) orbiting it, which was the first hot Jupiter to be discovered. This addon includes a fictional texture for the planet that's in approximate true color based on spectra, as well as a somewhat older fictional texture as an alternate surface.</p>
