<p>Giotto was an ESA robotic spacecraft that flew as part of an international fleet of space probes called the "Halley Armada". The spacecraft flew by and studied Halley's Comet and in doing so became the first spacecraft to make close up observations of a comet on 1986-Mar-13. Six years later, after performing the first ever Earth gravity assist maneuver, it flew past another comet, called Grigg-Skjellerup, on 1992-Jul-10. Shortly after this encounter, Giotto was finally decommissioned</p>
