<p><p>In 1999, a magnetic anomaly on the Moon's Tycho Crater led to the discovery of the first definitive evidence of intelligent extraterrestrial life that was buried there for more than three million years. It sent out a powerful radio signal aimed directly at Jupiter when Dr. Heywood Floyd and his colleagues examined it shortly afterwards.</p>
