<p>Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster is an electric sports car that served as the dummy payload for the maiden test flight of the Falcon Heavy rocket on February 6, 2018. It is the first production car launched into space, and it is currently defunct in a Mars-crossing orbit around the Sun after depleting its batteries four hours after launch. A mannequin in a spacesuit, named Starman, occupies the driver's seat.</p>
