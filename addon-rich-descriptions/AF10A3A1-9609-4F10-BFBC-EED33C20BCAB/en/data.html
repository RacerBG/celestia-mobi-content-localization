<p>The <strong>Smart Lander for Investigating Moon</strong> (<strong>SLIM</strong>) is a Japanese lunar lander that was launched in 2023-Sept-6 alongside the XRISM observatory. Its main purpose is to demonstrate precision landing within 100 m of its target site. On 2024-Jan-19, although it had problems during the final descent, it survived a relatively rough landing near Shioli Crater, making Japan the fifth country to land successfully on the Moon.</p>
