<p>MESSENGER was a NASA space probe with the aim of studying the planet Mercury. Launched on August 3, 2004, it passed once by Earth, twice by Venus and three times by Mercury before entering Mercury's orbit in March 18, 2011. MESSENGER studied and photographed Mercury until April 30, 2015, when its fuel ran out and the probe crashed into the planet's surface.</p>
