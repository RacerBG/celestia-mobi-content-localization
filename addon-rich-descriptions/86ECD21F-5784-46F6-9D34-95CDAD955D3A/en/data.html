<p>Satcom-K1 and Satcom-K2 were the two third-generation satellites operated by RCA Americom. Built on the AS-4000 bus by Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin), both were launched on two different shuttle missions in 1985 and 1986. Satcom-K1 was the last major commercial satellite ever deployed from the Space Shuttle, which were discontinued after the 1986 Challenger disaster</p>
