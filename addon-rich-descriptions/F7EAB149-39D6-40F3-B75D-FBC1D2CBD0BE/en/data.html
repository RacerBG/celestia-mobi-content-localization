<p>GJ 1252, aka TOI-1078, is a red dwarf located about 66.41 lightyears from the solar system. the star is host to a single hot, dead super-Earth (b= 1.193 Re, 1.32 Me). Observations from Spitzer, prior to it shutting down, determined that planet did not have a thick envelop and constrains any potential atmosphere to being no larger than about 1 bar of pressure. JWST can constrain this further should it ever look at this system.</p>
