<p>The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) is a joint NASA-DLR mission dedicated in studying how Earth's mass is distributed around the planet and how it varies over time. Twin satellites were first launched in 2002 and both operated until 2018. They were both quickly replaced by the follow-on mission, GRACE-FO, which used identical hardware as the original mission starting May 2018.</p>
