<p>MOA-2015-BLG-337L is a planetary system detected by microlensing in the constellation Sagittarius. There are two possible models for this system: a massive brown dwarf orbited by an object near the borderline between planets and brown dwarfs; or an object which itself has a mass borderline between planets and brown dwarfs, possibly a rogue planet, with a super-Neptune mass companion.

The former scenario is modeled by this addon, while the latter is modeled by the <a href="celaddon://item?item=16437BEC-3066-29D4-CFD9-BE32D78D35A8">Microlensing Rogue Planets</a> addon. Both addons are compatible since they define different copies of the system at different distances.</p>
