<p>2023 DW is a near-Earth asteroid estimated to be 48 m in diameter. Belonging to the Aten group, it is roughly the same size as the object that caused the <a href="celaddon://item?item=9AC63A62-869A-89C9-1E27-86062DEEE038">Tunguska event</a> in 1908. Previously, it had a 1-in-420 chance of colliding with Earth on 2046-Feb-14, but further observations ruled out this possibility and as of 2023-Mar-15, it will only come as close as 2.96 million km from our planet on that date</p>
