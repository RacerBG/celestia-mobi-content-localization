<p>The early Syncom satellites were 68-kg cylindrical spacecraft about 0.71 m in diameter. With the exception of Syncom I (which failed prematurely before reaching target orbit), these were the very first spacecraft ever sent into geosynchronous (Syncom II) and geostationary orbits (Syncom III) respectively. All satellites were launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA from 1963-1964, and the latter two satellites remain in operation until 1969.</p>
