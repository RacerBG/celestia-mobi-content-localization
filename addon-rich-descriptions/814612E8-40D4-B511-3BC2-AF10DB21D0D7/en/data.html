<p>Sputnik 2 was the second spacecraft ever sent into orbit, and the first one to carry a living animal in space, a dog named Laika, on 1957-Nov-3. However, the spacecraft was not designed to return to Earth, and Laika tragically died on the satellite's fourth orbit. The satellite continued its operations until the batteries depleted on 1957-Nov-10, before reentering the atmosphere on April 1958</p>
