<p>Exploration Flight Test-1 or EFT-1 was the maiden flight of NASA's Orion spacecraft. It was launched on 2014-Dec-5, 12:05 UTC by a Delta IV Heavy rocket from which it orbited Earth twice before testing its heat shield upon reentry about four hours into flight</p>
<p>NOTES:
    <ul>
        <li>EFT-1 can only be seen on 2014-Dec-5 from 12:05 to 16:29 UTC</li>
        <li>The XYZV trajectory used is only about less than 90% historically accurate due to lack of actual state vector data publicly available in sites such as JPL HORIZONS</li>
    </ul>
