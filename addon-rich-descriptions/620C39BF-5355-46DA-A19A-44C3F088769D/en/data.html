<p>Prospero, also known as the X-3, was a small 66-kg satellite that became the first (and last) spacecraft to have been sent into orbit by a British rocket. It was designed to undertake a series of experiments to study the effects of the space environment on communications satellites, It remained operational until 1973, however it is reportedly still active until as late as 2004. It was predicted to eventually reenter the Earth's atmosphere by 2070, but efforts to bring it back safely is currently being pursued by Skyrora since 2021</p>
