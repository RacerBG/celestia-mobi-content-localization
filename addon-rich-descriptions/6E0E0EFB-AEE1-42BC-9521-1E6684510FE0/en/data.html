<p><p>Gliese 367 is a red dwarf star 30.7 light-years away in the constellation of Vela. It hosts a transiting sub-Earth-sized planet in a very close orbit, which probably has a molten surface, as well as two outer super-Earth-mass planets. The star and innermost planet received the names Añañuca and Tahay as part of the third <a href="https://www.nameexoworlds.iau.org/2022edition">NameExoWorlds</a> campaign in 2023.</p>
<p>Tahay is depicted as a lava world; the default texture is intended to show its appearance in <i>reflected</i> light on the dayside. An alternate surface is included which depicts the planet as emissive (glowing).</p></p>
