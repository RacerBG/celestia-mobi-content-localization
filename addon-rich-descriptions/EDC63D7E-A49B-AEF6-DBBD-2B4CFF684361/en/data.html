<p>Dawn is a NASA spacecraft designed to study two of the three known protoplanets in the asteroid belt, Ceres and Vesta. It is the first spacecraft to orbit two extraterrestrial bodies, which is made possible by its use of ion propulsion. During its nine-year mission (2007-2018), it orbited Vesta from 2011-2012 and then orbited Ceres in 2015, which remains so to this day until its predicted crash sometime in 2044.</p>
