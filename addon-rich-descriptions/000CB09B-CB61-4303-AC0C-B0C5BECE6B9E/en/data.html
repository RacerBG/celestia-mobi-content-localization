<p><p>This is a slightly modified and resurrected basic package of Jestr's Star Wars add-on. It contains Tatooine, Endor and Death Star. This package is required for the most other Star wars add-ons by Jestr. The following modifications were made by Ulrich Dickmann (Adirondack) in December 2012 (corrected folder structure, fixed ssc file)</p>
