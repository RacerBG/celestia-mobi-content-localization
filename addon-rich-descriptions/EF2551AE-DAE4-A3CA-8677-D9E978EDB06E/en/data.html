<p>Galileo was a NASA orbiter/atmospheric probe that studied the planet Jupiter and its moons, as well as the asteroids 951 Gaspra and 243 Ida. It was delivered into Earth orbit on 1989-Oct-18 by Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-34). Galileo arrived at Jupiter on 1995-Dec-7, after gravitational assist flybys of Venus and Earth, and became the first spacecraft to orbit an outer planet. The mission lasted until 2003-Sept-21</p>
