<p>TOI-2285 is a red dwarf located about 136 light-years (42 pc) away from the solar system, the star hosts a sub-Neptunian (1.76 Earth Radii) planet with an eccentric orbit interior to its habitable zone, its mass hasn't been nailed down yet but is under 19.5 Earth masses according to the study that confirmed the planets existence. The same study reports that although the planet orbits too close to the star for a rocky planet to host liquid water, a planet with a thick atmosphere could, in theory, have a layer of liquid water underneath.</p>
