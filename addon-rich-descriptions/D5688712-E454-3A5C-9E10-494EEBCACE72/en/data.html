<p>Luna 19 and Luna 22 were the twin Soviet spacecraft that mapped the lunar surface in 1971-1972 and 1974-1975 respectively. They were basically Lunokhod rovers redesigned to become 5.7 ton lunar orbiters, among the heaviest such spacecraft ever launched. They were left derelict in lunar orbit until they crashed somewhere on the lunar surface on unknown dates, presumably at most a year after last contact with Earth</p>
