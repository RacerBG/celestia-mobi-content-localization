<p>On September 26, 2022 the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission by NASA and the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) successfully demonstrates a method of planetary defense by crashing itself onto Dimorphos, the moon of the asteroid 65803 Didymos. Launched in 2021-Nov-24 from a Falcon 9, DART is designed to simulate a method of planetary defense called kinetic impactors, where a spacecraft uses its entire mass to slam itself onto an asteroid to knock off its course a little if its headed directly to Earth. The asteroids Didymos and Dimorphos themselves do not cross into Earth's orbit, and there's no chance they'll pose a threat to our planet for a foreseeable future even the mission itself goes awry</p>
<p>The whole event is recorded by a small cubesat called LICIACube, where it studied the immediate aftermath just 2 minutes and 45 seconds after the impact of DART to the asteroid moon. Analysis of the main probe's effects to the asteroid itself will be conducted by a European follow-up mission, called Hera, as early as 2026</p>
