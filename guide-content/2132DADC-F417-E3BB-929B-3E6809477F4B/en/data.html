<p><a href="/resources/itemsByAuthor?author=Trolligi">Trolligi</a> has created an official trailer for Project Sisyphus on YouTube! Launched in March 15, 2020 by <a href="/resources/itemsByAuthor?author=Gurren%20Lagann">Gurren Lagann</a>, its long-term goal is to texture every single exoplanet known, despite the ever-growing count of newly confirmed planetary systems, for Celestia.</p>
<br>
<p>As of December 19, 2022 around <strong>425 out of 3,991</strong> confirmed planetary systems have been successfully textured (accounting to 10.62% of all known systems), and is continually growing thanks to many add-on developers across the globe! Around <strong>274</strong> of these are currently available for download on Celestia Mobile, on the <a href="https://celestia.mobi/resources/categories?parent=1B0E1953-C21C-D628-7FA6-33A3ABBD1B40">Exoplanets</a> category. This figure does not include <a href="https://celestia.mobi/resources/category?category=BAE0F719-A734-400B-B19D-D2626B3D186B">rogue planets</a>, <a href="https://celestia.mobi/resources/category?category=903EF64A-7C11-23A1-902A-E2F52001BED7">unconfirmed</a> and <a href="https://celestia.mobi/resources/category?category=105D3A34-2DBB-25F3-6E22-706D64C88128">disproven</a> exoplanets</p>
