<p>
    Celestia is now available on Xbox. The Xbox version is based on Celestia for Windows 10 and has most of the functionality that the desktop version has.
    Before getting started, it is best that you read the following notes.
</p>
<h3>Download</h3>
<p>Celestia for Xbox is available on Microsoft Store. You can get it <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/celestia/9PF9PHRTKW3Q?hl=en-us&gl=us">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Basic Navigation</h3>
<p>
    Like other apps on Xbox, Celestia uses the same navigation system. When the UI overlay is activated (for example, when you open a dialog or activate the menu via menu button), you can navigation
    through the buttons using the thumbstick or direction pad buttons. Press A and most likely you will invoke the action that the focus is in. Press B and most likely you will
    close the dialog or other overlay.
</p>
<h3>Controller Actions</h3>
<p>
    The vanilla Celestia for Win32 has limited support for game controllers, but we've added support more game controller button actions and features.
    A list of game controller actions is provided <a href="/help/game-controller">here</a>. To customize the button and thumbstick actions, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>Press menu/select button to bring up the menu</p>

<p>Navigate into the settings, and change actions according to your like</p>
<p><img class="full-width-image" src="{4}"></p>
<p>When you are done, go back by pressing button B</p>
<h3>Free Flight Mode</h3>
<p>With a game controller you can explore with free flight mode of Celestia. The setting is in Navigation, Flight Mode. To learn more about flight modes, visit <a href="/help/flight-mode">here</a>.</p>
