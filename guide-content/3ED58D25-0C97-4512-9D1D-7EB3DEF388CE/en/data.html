<p>After 10 days in space, Astrobotic's <strong>Peregrine Mission One</strong> met its fiery end over the South Pacific Ocean around 21:04 UTC today (Jan. 18th). Launched during Vulcan Centaur's maiden flight on 2024-Jan-8, it was the United States' first lunar landing attempt since Apollo 17 in 1972, however a propulsion system failure just six hours into flight precluded this from ever happening.</p>
<p>Carrying eight instruments and two rovers, the lander was supposed to arrive in lunar orbit by January 23rd, and is planned to touch down just exactly a month later on 2024-Feb-23, on an area just south of Mons Gruithuisen Gamma called Sinus Viscositatis. It is the first of many missions under NASA's <i>Commercial Lunar Payload Services</i> (CLPS) program</p>
