<p>On November 16, 2022 the Space Launch System rocket has lifted off successfully on its maiden flight, carrying an Orion spacecraft and a number of cubesats to the Moon and beyond. The launch is the first leg of a mission in which Orion is planned to travel approximately 40,000 miles beyond the Moon and return to Earth over the course of 25.5 days. Known as <b>Artemis 1</b>, the mission is a critical part of NASA’s Moon to Mars exploration approach, in which the agency explores for the benefit of humanity. It’s an important test for the agency before flying astronauts on the <b>Artemis 2</b> mission</p>
<br>
<p>Through Artemis missions, NASA will land the first woman and the first person of color on the surface of the Moon, paving the way for a long-term lunar presence and serving as a steppingstone for astronauts on the way to Mars</p>
