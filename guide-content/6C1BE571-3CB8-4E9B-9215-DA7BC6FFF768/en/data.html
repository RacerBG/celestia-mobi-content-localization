<p>On August 23, 2023 the Indian Space Research Organization's <i><strong>Chandrayaan-3</strong></i> mission lands successfully on a region between the Manzinus C and Simpelius N craters, marking India the fourth country to successfully land on the Moon. Launched in July 14, 2023 the mission is a repeat of its predecessor, Chandrayaan-2, of which the latter's lander was destroyed on its landing attempt in 2019. The landing site was named <strong>Shiv Shakti Point</strong>, and is located on <strong><u>69.367621°S 32.348126°E</u></strong>. A few days prior, the Russian Luna 25 lander was lost after a programming error during its descent orbit insertion caused it to crash to the lunar surface</p>
<br>
<p>Both the lander (Vikram-2) and the rover (Pragyan-2) are designed to study the lunar surface for 14 Earth-days, and are expected to cease operations by lunar nightfall (NET Sept 4th). Like its predecessor, the orbiter portion will continue to study the Moon for a long period of time, at least 6 months or longer</p>
