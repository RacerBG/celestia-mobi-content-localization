<p>Celestia has full support for game controllers. When your device is paired with a supported game controller, Celestia starts receiving inputs from the controller automatically with no action required (On Win32, you can use F8 to toggle game controller control).</p>
<p>While vanilla Celestia for Win32 only uses a limited number of buttons (see <a href="celguide://guide?guide=BE1B5023-46B6-1F10-F15F-3B3F02F30300">here</a>), Celestia on Android/iOS/macOS/Windows(UWP) adds a layer of customization which enables uses of more buttons. You can find out about them in Settings -> Game Controller (on Windows, it is File -> Settings -> Game Controller).</p>
<h3>Buttons</h3>
<p>For the buttons listed in the settings, you can assign an action to each of them. The Menu/Select button is kept for showing the menu.</p>
