<p>Most spacecraft addons available for download in Celestia do not readily appear right away on Celestia for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The most likely reason is that it simply DOES NOT EXIST ANYMORE in REAL LIFE. For example, you can only see <a href="celaddon://item?item=3B72676B-7D83-3860-D27E-26D2BE8C0FDA">Mir</a> from 1986 to 2001, and <a href="celaddon://item?item=59AF2D3E-62EF-FDDB-A0F7-6980B7DCE265">Cassini</a> from 1997 to 2017.</li>
  <li>Alternatively, it simply isn't launched yet until a specific time in the future. For example, you can only view <a href="celaddon://item?item=13D974FA-19C2-9460-C628-A292E83A8BA8">JUICE</a> from 2023 onwards</li>
</ul>
<p>For <b>PC Version 1.6.2</b> and older, you can use Jan Stegehuis's <a href="https://www.celestiamotherlode.net/catalog/show_addon_details.php?addon_id=1539">Spacecraft Goto</a> script to automatically jump in time on when a specific satellite mission operated in real life. Unfortunately, this doesn't work on PC Version 1.7.0 and all Mobile Versions.</p>
<p>That being said, here are the <b>Mobile Version</b>'s steps on how to make past and future spacecraft appear on Celestia:</p>
<br>
<h3>Step 1: Search for a Spacecraft and Go to Settings</h3>
<p><i>We will use <a href="celaddon://item?item=3B72676B-7D83-3860-D27E-26D2BE8C0FDA">Mir</a> as an example. As you can notice, Mir doesn't appear on the date shown on top right. This is because the old space station crashed onto the Pacific Ocean way back in March 2001</i></p>

<br>
<h3>Step 2: Search for Current Time</h3>
<p><i>It is located under the Time & Region section</i></p>
<p><img class="full-width-image" src="{1}"></p>
<br>
<h3>Step 3: Click Select Time</h3>
<p><i>Make sure your Time Zone is set to UTC first, since the Beginning/Ending dates of all spacecraft in Celestia are coded in UTC and not in Local Time</i></p>

<br>
<h3>Step 4: Type the Date of your Preference</h3>
<p><i>To prevent yourself from wild guessing the dates, you can always click the Web Info button of each spacecraft hidden on the Info button (see screenshot from <b>Step 1</b>).</i></p>

<br>
<h3>Step 5: Congratulations!</h3>
<p><i>You have successfully viewed the spacecraft with all of its glory! For some spacecraft, you can also use the <b>Time Control</b> button to see the missions' changes over the years</i></p>
