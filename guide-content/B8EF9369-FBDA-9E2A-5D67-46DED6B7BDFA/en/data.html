<p>On January 11, 2023 Roscosmos ultimately decided to launch <strong>Soyuz MS-23</strong> without a crew by February 20th to replace <strong>Soyuz MS-22</strong>, which was concluded to be unsafe for crew return after suffering a coolant leak on 2022-Dec-15 caused by orbital debris or micrometeoroid strike. The current seven-person crew aboard the ISS are all perfectly safe despite the incident. This will also be the first time an uncrewed Soyuz spacecraft replaced another one in orbit since the <strong>Soyuz 32</strong> and <strong>Soyuz 34</strong> missions aboard <a href="celaddon://item?item=FF47F01E-3583-92F1-3C14-C152D503DC9C"><strong>Salyut 6</strong></a> in 1979</p>

<p>For context, Soyuz MS-22 launched to the ISS on 2022-Sept-21, with <strong>Sergei Prokopyev</strong>, <strong>Dmitri Petelin</strong>, and <strong>Frank Rubio</strong> as part of the station's <strong>Expedition 67/68</strong> crew. The original crew of Soyuz MS-23 (<strong>Oleg Kononenko</strong>, <strong>Nikolai Chub</strong> and <strong>Frank Rubio</strong>) were subsequently reassigned to Soyuz MS-24. Since another replacement Soyuz spacecraft would not be available for another seven months, the MS-22 crew will inadvertently become the fourth crew to stay aboard the ISS for an entire year when they finally return to Earth aboard MS-23 on September 2023</p>
